## Car Collision Severity Forecast

### Introduction:

Weather conditions, road layout and high volumes of traffic can increase the risk of car accidents. This can result in death, injury, and financial loss for those directly involved in a collision, but also huge delays and inconvenience for those travelling behind a vehicle which ends up in a collision.

Can we avoid being caught up in or behind a collision due to conditions known to increase the risk of collisions? Can we use machine learning to forecast the risk of collisions on a given route based on existing conditions, and from this have the option to take a different route or travel at a different time? Even if we cannot avoid the route, would a forecast of collision probability encourage safer driving, or be used alongside variable speed limits to make conditions safer? In this project, available collision data will be explored with a view to using machine learning to forecast the probability of an accident given traffic and weather conditions for a given route.

Initially the SDOT Collision data will be used to explore the relationships between various features and collision severity, and see whether a good enough model can be made to reliably forecast collisions.
